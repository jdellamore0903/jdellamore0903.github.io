								<h2>About</h2>
								<p>Hello! My name is John Dellamore and I am a professional in New York City. Through my time at NYU and following graudation, I have had the opportunity to work on some great projects in a variety of fields. At the moment, I am working towards becoming an experienced software developer and hope I can work on more projects that incorporate this skill set.</p>
								<p>Outside of my professional aspirations, I enjoy working with the NYU Debate Team, reading a variety of post-modern philosophy and playing chess in the park. I also really enjoy traveling and biking around the city.</p>

								<h2>Financial Services</h2>
								<p>I currently work at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch where I cover risk for trading desks across fixed income, currencies and commodities ("FICC") trading. I primarily work with the short end and structured financing desks. Although the bulk of what I cover is driven by central bank activity, a few of the desks facilitate client trading in the markets.</p>
								<p>Prior to my current role, I spent a few months at J.P. Morgan where I worked on the Multi-Asset Solutions Strategy team and MB Financial where I worked within the corporate bank. </p>

								<h2>Software Development</h2>
								<p>I became really interested in software development and programming during my junior year at J.P. Morgan. While there, I worked on a project that involved a significant amount of data analysis and was able to work alongside some of the developers.</p>
								<p>Following the experience I began to learn python on my own and then followed my interest into a coding bootcamp at Actualize Coding School. While at the bootcamp I got to work on a variety of really awesome projects and development my own web application that creates an online debate forum. I am currently working in their apprenticeship program, working on a CRM application. I am really excited to continue my learning in this subject matter!</p>

								<h2>Debate</h2>
								<p>Debate will probably be my biggest love for the rest of my life. I began debating for my high school in Chicago during my junior year and then continued for four years in college. Currently, I am the Assistant Director of Debate at NYU, where I coach and travel across the country with the team.</p>
								<p>While an entire page should be dedicated to why I love debate so much, I can generalize and say that I love debate because it offers infinite possibility to learn on a variety of subject matters across all fields. When most people think of debate, they see debaters arguing "eloquently" in suits, citing Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Moore. Over my 6 years competing, I never wore a suit, debated at a speed akin to an auctioneer and cited everyone from national security experts at the Brookings Institute to artists in the DADA art movement. Debate never allows you to know everything and will allow you to challenge conventional fact with a strong set of arguments. I am so happy to still be part of the community and hope I can be for years to come.</p>

								<h2>Academic/Professional Interests and Curiosities</h2>
								<p>Below is a list of topics that I find extremely interesting and am working to learn more about in my free time. I will try to continually update this with new things I am looking at. If you are interested, I would love to chat about some of these topics over coffee so please reach out! If you have any resources that you find useful and awesome, please send them over!</p>

									<h3>Postmodern Debate Arguments</h3>
									<p>I have always been very interested in philosophical debate arguments called kritiques (spelled with a "k" to pay homage to Kant). Lately, I have gone further down the postmodernism path, reading and creating arguments based on works by Foucault, Lyotard and Baudrillard. I have always liked this body of work but this years topic on healthcare lends itself to many of these philosophical ideas such as biopolitics (Foucault) and simulations (Baudrillard). One particular interesting book I read recently was The Birth of the Clinic by Foucault. I really enjoyed the historical overview of how hospitals and the study of medicine evolved over time (with a focus on France).</p>
								</li>

									<h3>Switch Side Web App</h3>
									<p>Switch Side was my capstone project at Actualize Coding School. The jist fo the app is to create a structured debate forum online, akin to "policy debate" (the best type of debate). The structured arguments input by the users could not only provide an interesting format to guide future research but could also be an interesting way to generate data for natural language processing algorithms. What I mean by this is a "card" in debate is an argument provided by the user that summarizes the "card text", which is an academic or journalistic article. Interestingly enough, in debate we call the first part of the "card" a tag, which is exactly what it would be called within a training data set. The data set of article text tagged with a summary may provide an interest data set for programs that try to automate a portion of the research process.</p>
								</li>

									<h3>Neural Networks/Machine Learning</h3>
									<p>I am fascinated by machine learning algorithms and the role of this field in data analysis. I became very interested in this subject when I was at J.P. Morgan and then further at Bank of America where I got to work with some of the trading algoirthms. Right now, I am going through the Stanford CS231n course (Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition) </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Travelling!</h3>
									<p>Slightly more vague but something I have been doing a lot of recently. I have always really enjoyed travelling, especially when I get the chance to be outdoors. Over the last year I have been through a handful places across the US and Buenos Aires, Argentina (twice!). I always love to hear about interesting places so let me know!</p>
